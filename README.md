## Overview
This is an assignment for BootCamp Spot, week 10, as part of their Full Stack Coding Bootcamp as offered via UC Berkeley continuing education. It is a simple logo creator in the svg format using Node JS command prompts entered by user in a coding terminal.

* The program prompts the user initially for a logo up to three digits in length.
* Next it prompts for a text color, first asking the user if they want to select from a list or use a hexadecimal code.
* If the hexadecimal color is entered incorrectly, the program will ask the user to try again.
* Next it prompts for a shape (circle, square, triangle, hexagon, inverted triangle).
* It also prompts for a background color.
* Finally it prompts for a choice of one of several fonts.
* When the logo is generated, a confirmation is printed on a command line and a logo.svg file is generated in an /outputs file.
* You can also test it using jest.
